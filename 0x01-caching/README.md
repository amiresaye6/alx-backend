## What is a Caching System?

A caching system is a component of a computer system that stores data temporarily to serve future requests more quickly. It stores copies of frequently accessed data in a cache, which is faster to access than the original source.

## Common Caching Algorithms

### FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
FIFO is a caching algorithm where the oldest cached items are removed first when the cache is full.

### LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)
LIFO is a caching algorithm where the most recently cached items are removed first when the cache is full.

### LRU (Least Recently Used)
LRU is a caching algorithm that removes the least recently used items from the cache when the cache is full.

### MRU (Most Recently Used)
MRU is a caching algorithm that removes the most recently used items from the cache when the cache is full.

### LFU (Least Frequently Used)
LFU is a caching algorithm that removes the least frequently used items from the cache when the cache is full.

## Purpose of Caching Systems

The purpose of caching systems is to improve system performance by reducing latency and improving responsiveness. Caching systems help in serving frequently requested data quickly, reducing the need to access slower storage systems or perform expensive computations repeatedly.

## Limitations of Caching Systems

While caching systems offer significant performance benefits, they also have limitations:
- Limited Cache Size: Caching systems have a finite cache size, leading to cache eviction and potential data loss.
- Cache Invalidation: Ensuring that cached data remains valid and consistent with the original source can be challenging, especially in distributed systems.
- Cache Coherency: Maintaining cache coherency across multiple cache instances or nodes in a distributed system can be complex.
- Cold Start: When a cache is empty or cleared, it may experience a "cold start" where performance is temporarily reduced until the cache is populated again.
